# MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

### The project exposes learners to lots of concepts involve in programming and the act of building a working solutions as well as essential configurations that will aid deployment.

### It focus span accross different unique task, whose aim is to ensure you have a solid grasp of a concept.

### In this project, we build a TO-DO APP to help keep track of our daily task. 

### We desigened our frontend application using React.js that communicate with a backend application written in Express.js. We also ultilized Mongodb to store and manage our database

### Also, learners will be introduced to POSTMAN and API consumption. They will have the opportunity to learn about CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations as they will be tasked to consume all the endpoints (POST, GET and DELETE) requests.


### In summary, This project is based on the techniques invoved to successfully deploy a MERN stack software project.

### it inculdes tasks such as:

* Backend Configuration
* ExpressJS Installation
* Models
* API Consumption.
* MongoDB Database
* Frontend Creation



### Thanks.
